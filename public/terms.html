          <h2>"AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer</h2>
          <p>The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects without warranty
            of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on
            behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims
            all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all

            limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of

            corrected.</p>

          <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable
            statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You.
